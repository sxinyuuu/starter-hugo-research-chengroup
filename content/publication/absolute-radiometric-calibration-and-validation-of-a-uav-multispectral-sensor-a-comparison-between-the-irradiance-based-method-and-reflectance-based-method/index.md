abstract: Through an unmanned vehicle payload calibration campaign experiments,
  both reflectance-based and irradiance-based methods are used to calibrate
  multispectral sensor. The results show that both methods achieved good linear
  relationships between the digital numbers and apparent radiances (R2 > 0.99).
  Validation results demonstrated the relative error between the radiometric
  calibration and radiative transfer calculation ranged from 0.91% to 21.05%.
  The error analysis suggested that the irradiance-based method is less
  sensitive to aerosol parameters. However, the relative differences between
  these two methods are small under low aerosol loading conditions, suggesting
  the irradiance-based method may be a good option with some improvements.
