abstract: Black carbon (BC) aerosol in urban environments potentially affects
  the local environment, the regional climate cycle, and even human health. A
  two-year field measurement (May 2014 to July 2016) of BC and particulate
  matter in Xuzhou, a large industrial city and the economic center of Huaihai
  Economic Zone in central China, was conducted. The average annual
  concentrations of BC, PM1.0, PM2.5, and PM10 were 2.44 µg m–3, 56.6 µg m–3,
  61.8 µg m–3, and 75.8 µg m–3, respectively. The highest daily average for the
  BC concentrations was 11.6 µg m–3, and more than 10% of the hourly BC
  measurements had concentrations above 5 µg m–3. All of the BC and PM
  concentrations displayed two diurnal peaks (during rush hours in the morning
  and in the evening) and one valley (in the afternoon). The overall BC
  concentrations, and the BC fractions in the PM were higher in winter and
  spring, whereas the overall PM concentrations were higher in winter and
  autumn. The backward trajectory analysis indicated that most of the high BC
  concentrations in Xuzhou were associated with north and northwest winds, and
  the potential source contribution function (PSCF) model proved that the
  provinces of central China were the most likely source regions. Our findings
  can be used to set appropriate atmospheric pollution control measures for
  these central provinces and to increase the accuracy of air quality
  forecasting.
