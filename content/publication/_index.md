abstract: Black carbon (BC) is an important component of atmospheric aerosols;
  BC aerosols are produced mainly by the incomplete combustion of
  carbon-containing substances, and they have important effects on climate
  change, the atmospheric environment, and public health. Most of the existing
  research has focused on the single-band measurement results of BC aerosols.
  However, each band offers different information regarding the optical
  absorption properties of aerosols, such as enhanced light absorption by brown
  carbon in the 370 nm band. To bridge this research gap, the present study used
  BC concentration data measured by an AE42 aethalometer to analyze the
  multiband pollution characteristics of BC aerosols in Xuzhou city in China. An
  aethalometer model was established to quantitatively describe the
  concentrations of BC produced by solid and liquid fuels, and a
  concentration-weighted trajectory analysis was used to analyze the potential
  sources of BC aerosols in Xuzhou and their contributions to the total BC. The
  following results were obtained. (1) The BC concentration was high in spring
  and winter and low in summer and autumn, and the diurnal variation showed
  bimodal characteristics. (2) The difference among the aerosol concentrations
  in the seven bands was larger in autumn and winter than in spring and summer,
  and the contribution of brown carbon in autumn and winter was greater than
  that in spring and summer. (3) In winter, the solid source (coal and biomass
  combustion) of BC accounted for a large proportion of the total BC. (4) A
  source analysis of BC pollution days and BC clean days indicated different
  sources of BC pollution in different seasons. The results of this study
  provide a theoretical basis and realistic guide for the prevention and control
  of atmospheric pollution in Xuzhou and are anticipated to be of great
  significance for improving the regional and global atmospheric environment.
