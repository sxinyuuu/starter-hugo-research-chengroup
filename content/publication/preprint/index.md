title: Google Earth Engine–assisted black carbon radiative forcing calculation
  over a heavy industrial city in China
abstract: Black carbon (BC) aerosol has a low content in the atmosphere;
  however, it has a strong radiative forcing effect and a significant impact on
  human beings and the environment. BC aerosol radiative forcing (ARF) has a
  major environmental influence. The main method to calculate the ARF is
  numerical simulation using a radiation transfer model by inputting atmospheric
  and surface parameters. Currently, most research studies directly apply the
  albedo products, which are not the real surface albedo (the blue-sky albedo).
  Alternatively, they use an empirical formula to calculate the sky diffuse
  light ratio to obtain the real surface albedo. To overcome these shortcomings,
  this study develops a new scheme to obtain the BC ARF in Xuzhou City from May
  2014 to July 2016 by combining the BC mass concentration, albedo measurements
  from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, aerosol optical depth (AOD), and
  microphysical parameters retrieved from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET).
  Although BC AOD accounts for 3.3 to 17.9% of the total AOD, the BC ARF at the
  surface (SFC) and top of the atmosphere (TOA) is between − 14.06 ± 4.645 W/m2
  and − 4.04 ± 0.437 W/m2 and between 2.93 ± 1.034 W/m2 and 0.74 ± 0.093 W/m2,
  with average values of − 9.67 ± 2.787 W/m2 and 2.02 ± 0.587 W/m2,
  respectively. Finally, comparing the BC ARF obtained by different albedo
  methods shows that the BC ARF change at the TOA is marked, and generally, the
  BC ARF calculated by the empirical formula method is lower than that
  calculated by using the blue-sky albedo method.
